# coupon-prediction
Predict customers who will use coupons. Tmall is a large online retailer as a part of Alibaba's business. Tmall provides coupons to customers to promote sales. The data include multiple dimensions of customers' information, including age, marriage status, job, credit purchase(loan), loan default, history of using coupons and returning products. 
<br/><br/>*Using the data, I analyzed factors that correlate with whether customers will use coupons or not, and did some exploratory visualizations and analysis. I then created eight models, including Baseline Model, SMOTE, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM(liner hyperplane), SVM(non-linear hyperplane). 
<br/><br/>*These models can help Tmall to identify price-sensitive customers who will use coupons and send coupons or give discounts to target customers. Tmall can do experiments by adjusting coupon types, and update models based on new data collected from different promotions, which can help Tmall to customize coupons for different types of customers.  
<br/>*You can see the exploratory analysis in the 'Exporation.ipynb' notebook, and the visualization images are saved in the 'evisual' folder.  You can see the model code in the 'algo.ipynb' notebook. You can find the model performance visualizations in the 'mvisual' folder. You can also see all visualizations by the links in the folders above.
